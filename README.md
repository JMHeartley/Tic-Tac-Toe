## ☝️ About
Choose to match up against the CPU or a friend 🤔 After a winning streak against the CPU is broken, you can enter your name on the leaderboard 🥇

This project started when I first learned to program years ago ⌚ After I wrote [dreamlo.js](https://github.com/JMHeartley/dreamlo.js), I revamped this game by adding a leaderboard for consecutive wins against the CPU  💪



## 📖 How to Play
Tic-tac-toe is a simple and classic game played by two players on a 3 by 3 grid. Each player takes a turn placing their symbol (❌ or ⭕) in one of the empty squares.

To win, a player must be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
